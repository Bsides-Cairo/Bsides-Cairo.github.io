  title: "Ransomware and Egypt: The Threat and How to Protect Your Organization"
  description: "In 2017 Egypt was one of the top countries affected by the WannaCry Ransomware, and, unfortunately, things have not gotten better. According to Trend Micro, Egypt accounts for more than a third of all ransomware attacks in North Africa. Egypt is an attractive target for ransomware cybercriminals because there are so many new business starting up, but they have limited budget for security.
This talk will review the ransomware threats, and discuss ways you can help defend your organization from ransomware, even on a tight budget. It will also provide an overview of resources you can use to better understand the threat and where to focus your limited security budget."
