-  Customized talk.

##### Stage discussions:

We loved the event format of BSides Zurich, where, after each talks session, speakers move to separate rooms where attendees who are interested in their talks can join them and engage in active discussions along with snacks and coffee. And this year we give all attendees chance to ask and engage with speakers as stage discussions at the same hall.
**So, we have setted up some side-discussion tables where speakers and attendees can continue chatting about the talkâ€™s topic in a more easy way.**



#### Rookies & Mentors:

We appreciate BSides London success story for Rookie Track. The purpose of the "Rookie Track" is to give those who have not previously given a talk the opportunity to do so, whether you are a student still at university, someone who has recently made the conversion to security or someone who has been in the industry for years.
**So,we have 'Rookie Track' to give you an opportunity to be speaker and mentors will be available to help during submission processes.**

- Binary exploitation

#### Review Process:

After the CFP deadline, our review board have 1 month to look over all submissions and give a score to each proposal. A rejection and an acceptance lists will be built based on the given scores.
The proposals with the highest score will move to the first batch of acceptance notice and strong rejections will be immediately sent out too.
In the next few weeks the board will start contacting the authors with the highest scores to confirm their proposals acceptance and start filling the conference program. If the accepted speaker doesn't respond, doesn't want to or can't attend anymore, the board will move on with the next highest scored proposals in the acceptance list.
Once the conference program is full, the board starts to provide feedback for the remaining submissions. We hope to manage notifying all the confirmed speakers at least 15 days before the conference date.



If you have any doubt or question about the CFP, please reach out to us via email or Twitter.
